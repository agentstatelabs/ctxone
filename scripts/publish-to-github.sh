# publish-to-github — gated push of a public repo's main branch + release tags
# to GitHub. Replaces GitLab push mirroring so that:
#   * ONLY main and release tags reach GitHub (never internal branches such as
#     claude/* or worktree-agent-*, which push mirroring would expose), and
#   * NOTHING pushes until scripts/leak-scan.sh passes (fail closed).
#
# Intended to run in GitLab CI (see .gitlab-ci.yml `publish-github`). Requires:
#   GITHUB_REPO   — "org/name" of the target GitHub repo
#   GITHUB_TOKEN  — PAT with `repo` scope (masked + protected CI variable)
#   TAG_PREFIX    — optional; only tags matching this are published (default: v)
#
# Exit: 0 pushed (or nothing to do), 1 leak-scan blocked, 2 misconfig.

# repo, catastrophically slow (a 476-commit full-history scan ran for minutes).
#
# Incremental only when GitHub's main is a true ancestor of HEAD (the normal
# fast-forward case). First publish (no remote main) or any divergence falls
# back to a full HEAD scan — fail safe, never fail open.
